    <p>From the flavor text, Guild of the Fabled is synonymous with League of Legends, and Alice&apos;s referral to the playable characters as &ldquo;champions&rdquo; reinforces this as well. Bob&apos;s referral to the playable characters as &ldquo;heroes&rdquo;, as well as &ldquo;protect[ing] the primordial village&rdquo;, suggests Defence of the Ancients.</p>

<p>The six excerpts are independent, and each description of the suspect clues a LoL champion. The first letters of each character&apos;s name and epithet matches that of a LoL champion. Bob&apos;s first line is a description of the champion&apos;s physical appearance, followed by a description with words common to their ability names, which can be found <a href="https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_champions" target="_blank">here</a>, which aids with identification. Each champion is uniquely identifiable by the name and epithet given by Alice, as well as the description given by Bob.</p>

<p>The next step is to match the epithets of these champions to a corresponding hero from DotA. Alice&apos;s second line calling each character by epithet instead of name suggests the epithet to be important. Further, &ldquo;turning into the ideal hero&rdquo; suggests that solvers might want to try mapping these epithets to appropriate DotA characters (called heroes). A simple Google search putting &ldquo;DotA&rdquo; in front of the epithet (e.g. DotA Mad Chemist) is likely to yield the appropriate heroes. For the remaining parts of each excerpt, each line mentions a fictional ability with the same initials as a real ability belonging to the hero and a number which is used to index and extract from the ability&apos;s name. All heroes and their abilities can be found <a href="https://dota2.fandom.com/wiki/Heroes" target="_blank">here</a>. This gives us the answer, <strong>VILLAGE OFFICER</strong>.</p>

<h2>Author's Notes</h2>
<p>I was actually surprised that to date, I have not found a puzzle about either League of Legends or Defense of the Ancients, so I decided to write one about it. Previous versions of this puzzle attempted different ways to map each LoL champion to a unique DotA hero, or vice versa, but the game developers knew well enough to make sure that characters with similar appearances do not have similar abilities, and vice versa; and that between any two characters, there are only one to two abilities with similar mechanics. So most of those mapping attempts came to nought when I couldn&apos;t get sufficient matches. I also toyed with the idea of using hotkeys QWER to clue the abilities, since both games use the same hotkeys, but that didn’t come to fruition &ndash; perhaps for a future puzzle, it will.</p>
<p>This is also the first hunt puzzle I have ever written, so I tried to keep it on the simple side. Hopefully the googling wasn&apos;t too tedious.</p>
<p>[Update after Silph:] Wow &ndash; we certainly did not expect this puzzle, out of all, to get sniped a week before our hunt. What&apos;s even more miraculous is that this puzzle originally involved an extraction via keybindings as well, so technically this puzzle got double sniped!</p>
