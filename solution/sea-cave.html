    <p>The puzzle presents 15 clips, with only one actual word being sung in each of them. Start by figuring out what the songs are. Songs were chosen to have titles that only use the one word being sung from another song, so there should only be 1-3 that need to be checked to figure out which songs these are. This creates a chain. The next step is to realize that each of the words are sung repeatedly within the song themselves. From the flavortext hinting you to &ldquo;count&rdquo;, the next step is to convert the number of times the word is sung within each song to alphabets.</p>

<p>This gives us the intermediate answer HELP SING ONE BACK. Upon submitting this answer, solvers receive instructions to send a similarly-sung, one-word song to us. Once complete, solvers will receive the answer, <strong>X AND Y ANNOUNCEMENT</strong>.</p>

<h2>Author's Notes</h2>
<p>This puzzle went through so many iterations, mainly because we really wanted to make a Disney puzzle that would work with the final answer (like Moana sending a letter). But the underlying idea just did not fit thematically. This idea came from Jimmy Fallon&apos;s <em>One Word Song Challenge</em>, and did not change from the start. After external testsolvers said the idea just did not work with our original Disney force fitting, aki suggested that it would fit very nicely with songs where a word was sung repeatedly.</p>
<p>[aki&apos;s comments:] I am truly sorry to everyone who had to listen to my terrible singing. Someone had to do it, and Jonathan was adamantly not going to sing. However, I hope you enjoyed the puzzle as much as I &ldquo;enjoyed&rdquo; (mileage may vary) listening to these songs! Some of these songs were real throwbacks to songs of the past decades.</p>
