<p>Once these are identified, we fill in the answer blanks at the bottom. The first number indicates the missing episode name to extract from, and the number in parentheses is the index into the episode title. This gives the final answer <strong>KINDER EGG SURPRISES</strong>.</p>

<h2>Author's Notes</h2>
<p>The hit Netflix shows <em>Squid Game</em> and <em>The Queen&apos;s Gambit</em> inspired me to rewrite this puzzle, especially since all our other puzzle ideas on TV shows all fell through and we did not have a single puzzle on TV shows. Hopefully this was also an easier puzzle that would help newer teams break in to the &ldquo;looking for patterns&rdquo;-type thinking that would have been necessary for extraction!</p>
